This was a desktop app I built for my high school. I noticed the manual and overly laborius manner in which their inventory was handled, so I thought to automate the process with some software!

It had 4 app screens:
- The home screen: Shows all the currently borrowed items, as well as their return due date and the borrower's information.
- The search screen: Allows the librarian to search for a particular item or borrower.
- The analytics page: Displays all relevant figures at a glance. It also featured a graph that would allow the librarian spot borrowing trends.
- The history page: Lists all borrowed and successfully returned items with other accompanying information.

I don't have the code anymore ðŸ˜­. It was stored on my old laptop, but [here's proof that I built it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PryzonOd9f0).
